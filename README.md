# find-divisors
Create a function named divisors/Divisors that takes an integer n > 1 and returns an array with all of the integer's divisors(except for 1 and the number itself), from smallest to largest. If the number is prime return the string '(integer) is prime' (null in C#) (use Either String a in Haskell and Result&lt;Vec&lt;u32>, String> in Rust).
